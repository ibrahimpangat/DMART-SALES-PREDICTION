# DMART-SALES-PREDICTION
Sales prediction is an important problem in the field of machine learning, which involves using historical sales data to predict future sales for a retail store like DMART. By creating an accurate sales prediction model, a store can make informed decisions on product stocking, pricing strategies, and marketing campaigns that can ultimately lead to increased sales and profits.

### The process of solving the DMART Sales prediction problem can be broken down into several steps:

1: Data Collection: Collect historical sales data for the various products sold at different outlets of the DMART store. This data should include relevant information such as the date of sale, product details (product type, price, etc.), and the amount of sales.

2: Data Cleaning: Clean and preprocess the data by checking for missing or incorrect values, handling outliers, and transforming variables if necessary. This step is crucial as it can have a significant impact on the model's performance.

3: Feature Selection: Select the most relevant features from the data that will be used to train the model. This involves identifying the variables that have the most significant impact on sales and including only those in the model.

4: Model Selection: Choose a suitable machine learning algorithm to train the model. The algorithm chosen should be capable of handling the problem's complexity and should provide good results based on the data. Some commonly used algorithms for this problem include linear regression, decision trees, and random forests.

5: Model Training: Train the model using the selected features and the algorithm. This involves using a portion of the data (training data) to fit the model and make predictions.

6: Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using the remaining portion of the data (test data). This involves comparing the predicted values to the actual values and calculating metrics such as mean absolute error or root mean squared error to measure the model's accuracy.

The process can be iterated multiple times to fine-tune the model and improve its performance. The ultimate goal is to create a model that can accurately predict the sales of different products in different outlets of the DMART store.
